Tenured, and, tenure, -, track, university, faculty, play, a, special, role, in, determining, the, speed, and, direction, of, scientific, progress, ,, both, directly, through, their, research, and, indirectly, through, their, training, of, new, researchers, .

Past, studies, establish, that, each, of, these, efforts, is, strongly, and, positively, influenced, through, various, forms, of, faculty, diversity, ,, including, ethnic, ,, racial, ,, and, gender, diversity, .

As, an, example, ,, research, shows, that, greater, diversity, within, a, community, or, group, can, lead, to, improved, critical, thinking, [, 1, ], and, more, creative, solutions, to, complex, tasks, [, 2, ,, 3, ], by, pairing, together, individuals, with, unique, skillsets, and, perspectives, that, complement, and, often, augment, the, abilities, of, their, peers, .

Despite, these, positive, effects, ,, however, ,, quantifying, the, impact, of, diversity, in, science, remains, exceedingly, difficult, ,, due, in, large, part, to, a, lack, of, comprehensive, data, about, the, scientific, workforce, .

Measuring, the, composition, and, dynamics, of, a, scientific, workforce, ,, particularly, in, a, rapidly, expanding, field, like, computer, science, ,, is, a, crucial, first, step, toward, understanding, how, scholarly, research, is, conducted, and, how, it, might, be, enhanced, .

Introduction
NOUN
Enjambment, takes, place, when, a, syntactic, unit, is, broken, up, across, two, lines, of, poetry, (, Domínguez, Caparrós, ,, 2000, :, 103, ), ,, giving, rise, to, different, stylistic, effects, (, e.g., increased, emphasis, on, elements, of, the, broken, -, up, phrase, ,, or, contrast, between, those, elements, ), ,, or, creating, double, interpretations, for, the, enjambed, lines, (, García, -, Paje, ,, 1991, ), .

In, Spanish, poetry, ,, the, syntactic, configurations, under, which, enjambment, takes, place, have, been, described, extensively, ,, and, detailed, studies, on, the, use, of, enjambment, by, individual, authors, exist, (, see, Martínez, Cantón, ,, 2011, for, an, overview, ), including, ,, among, others, Quilis, (, 1964, ), ,, Domínguez, Caparrós, ,, (, 2000, ), ,, Paraíso, ,, (, 2000, ), ,, Spang, (, 1983, ), for, a, description, of, enjambment, ,, and, Alarcos, (, 1966, ), ,, Senabre, (, 1982, ), ,, Luján, (, 2006, ), ,, Martínez, Fernández, (, 2010, ), for, case, -, studies, on, a, single, author, .

First, ,, the, literature, shows, a, debate, about, which, specific, syntactic, units, can, be, considered, to, trigger, enjambment, ,, if, split, across, two, lines, ,, and, whether, lexical, and, syntactic, criteria, are, sufficient, to, identify, enjambment, .

In, Spanish, tradition, ,, enjambment, (, in, Spanish, ,, ", encabalgamiento, ", ), is, considered, to, take, place, when, a, pause, suggested, by, poetic, form, (, e.g., at, the, end, of, a, line, or, across, hemistichs, ), occurs, between, strongly, connected, lexical, or, syntactic, units, ,, triggering, an, unnatural, cut, between, those, units, .

Introduction
NOUN
A, fundamental, tenet, of, linguistic, science, is, that, the, sound, of, a, word, has, a, purely, arbitrary, connection, to, the, word's, word, 's, meaning, [, 1, ], ,, [, 2, ], .

Thus, ,, the, sound, of, the, word, dog, in, English, is, connected, to, the, concept, ‘, dog, ’, by, historical, accident, and, not, by, any, natural, connection, ;, roughly, the, same, concept, is, just, as, well, denoted, in, French, by, chien, ,, denoted, in, German, by, hund, ,, and, denoted, in, Japanese, by, inu, .

But, it, is, not, that, a, word, can, have, just, any, vocal, sound, .
CCONJ, PRON, AUX, PART, SCONJ, DET, NOUN, AUX, VERB, ADV, DET, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT
While, the, possibility, space, for, sound, systems, of, the, world's, world, 's, language, is, enormous, ,, any, given, language, makes, use, of, only, a, restricted, portion, of, the, possible, sounds, [, 3, ], ,, [, 4, ], .

It, follows, from, these, two, basic, principles, –, the, ‘, arbitrariness, of, the, sign, ’, ,, and, the, ‘, selectiveness, of, particular, sound, systems, ’, –, that, the, words, that, exist, in, the, world's, world, 's, languages, should, sound, quite, different, from, each, other, ,, and, that, the, likelihood, that, there, are, universal, words, is, extremely, small, .

From, a, systematic, comparison, of, 10, spoken, languages, from, 5, continents, we, find, evidence, suggesting, that, a, word, like, ‘, Huh, ?, ’, –, used, as, a, ‘, repair, initiator, ’, when, ,, for, example, ,, one, has, not, clearly, heard, what, someone, just, said, [, 5, ], ,, [, 6, ], –, is, a, universal, word, .

In, support, of, the, first, claim, ,, we, show, that, the, similarities, in, form, and, function, of, an, interjection, with, the, specific, function, of, repair, initiation, are, very, much, greater, across, languages, than, chance, coincidence, would, admit, .

In, fact, the, variation, in, form, in, unrelated, languages, across, the, globe, is, about, the, same, as, the, variation, we, find, in, the, way, any, regular, word, (, e.g., ,, dog, ), is, pronounced, across, dialects, of, English, .

As, a, previous, step, to, designing, the, mutation, operators, ,, we, analyzed, the, main, technologies, used, specifically, in, the, development, of, GIS, ,, and, we, identified, typical, errors, a, programmer, can, introduce, during, the, development, .

These, errors, were, formalized, into, mutation, operators, .

From, these, data, ,, we, generate, the, mutation, operator, ,, in, the, form, of, on, aspect, ,, which, will, then, be, possible, to, interweave, with, the, SUT, which, generates, a, mutant, of, the, SUT, .

Nida's, Nida, 's, dynamic, -, equivalence, theory, is, often, held, in, opposition, to, the, views, of, philologists, who, maintain, that, an, understanding, of, the, source, text, (, ST, ), can, be, achieved, by, assessing, the, inter-animation, of, words, on, the, page, ,, and, that, meaning, is, self, -, contained, within, the, text, (, i.e., much, more, focused, on, achieving, semantic, equivalence, ), .

This, theory, ,, along, with, other, theories, of, correspondence, in, translating, ,, are, elaborated, in, his, essay, Principles, of, Correspondence, ,, where, Nida, begins, by, asserting, that, given, that, ", no, two, languages, are, identical, ,, either, in, the, meanings, given, to, corresponding, symbols, or, in, the, ways, in, which, symbols, are, arranged, in, phrases, and, sentences, ,, it, stands, to, reason, that, there, can, be, no, absolute, correspondence, between, languages, .

Hence, ,, there, can, be, no, fully, exact, translations, ., "

PROPN, ADV, VERB, ADP, DET, NOUN, ADP, NOUN, PUNCT, SCONJ, PRON, AUX, VERB, ADP, PRON, PUNCT, ADP, NUM, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT
The, nature, of, the, message, :

in, some, messages, the, content, is, of, primary, consideration, ,, and, in, others, the, form, must, be, given, a, higher, priority, .
ADP, DET, NOUN, DET, NOUN, AUX, ADP, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT, CCONJ, ADP, NOUN, DET, NOUN, AUX, AUX, VERB, DET, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT

to, give, information, on, both, form, and, content, ;
PART, VERB, NOUN, ADP, CCONJ, NOUN, CCONJ, NOUN, PUNCT

PART, VERB, ADP, ADJ, NOUN, ADP, DET, NOUN, SCONJ, PRON, SYM, PRON, AUX, VERB, DET, ADJ, NOUN, ADP, DET, NOUN, PUNCT
for, imperative, purposes, that, aim, at, not, just, understanding, the, translation, but, also, at, ensuring, no, misunderstanding, of, the, translation, .

prospective, audiences, differ, both, in, decoding, ability, and, in, potential, interest, .
ADJ, NOUN, VERB, CCONJ, SCONJ, VERB, NOUN, CCONJ, ADP, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT
Nida, brings, in, the, reminder, that, while, there, are, no, such, things, as, ", identical, equivalents, ", in, translating, ,, what, one, must, in, translating, seek, to, do, is, find, the, ", closest, natural, equivalent, ", .
PROPN, VERB, ADP, DET, NOUN, SCONJ, SCONJ, PRON, VERB, DET, ADJ, NOUN, ADP, PUNCT, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT, SCONJ, VERB, PUNCT, PRON, PRON, AUX, SCONJ, VERB, VERB, PART, VERB, AUX, VERB, DET, PUNCT, ADJ, ADJ, NOUN, PUNCT, PUNCT
Here, he, identifies, two, basic, orientations, in, translating, based, on, two, different, types, of, equivalence, :
ADV, PRON, VERB, NUM, ADJ, NOUN, SCONJ, VERB, VERB, ADP, NUM, ADJ, NOUN, ADP, NOUN, PUNCT
Formal, Equivalence, (, F, -, E, ), and, Dynamic, Equivalence, (, D, -, E, ), .
ADJ, PROPN, PUNCT, PROPN, PUNCT, PROPN, PUNCT, CCONJ, ADJ, PROPN, PUNCT, PROPN, PUNCT, PROPN, PUNCT, PUNCT
F, -, E, focuses, attention, on, the, message, itself, ,, in, both, form, and, content, .
PROPN, PUNCT, PROPN, VERB, NOUN, ADP, DET, NOUN, PRON, PUNCT, ADP, CCONJ, NOUN, CCONJ, NOUN, PUNCT
Such, translations, then, would, be, concerned, with, such, correspondences, as, poetry, to, poetry, ,, sentence, to, sentence, ,, and, concept, to, concept, .
ADJ, NOUN, ADV, AUX, AUX, VERB, ADP, ADJ, NOUN, ADP, NOUN, ADP, NOUN, PUNCT, NOUN, ADP, NOUN, PUNCT, CCONJ, NOUN, ADP, NOUN, PUNCT
Such, a, formal, orientation, that, typifies, this, type, of, structural, equivalence, is, called, a, ", gloss, translation, ", in, which, the, translator, aims, at, reproducing, as, literally, and, meaningfully, as, possible, the, form, and, content, of, the, original, .

The, philosopher, Michael, Ruse, takes, this, to, show, that, the, apparent, objectivity, of, morality, is, something, like, an, “, illusion, ”, foisted, on, us, by, our, genes, (, Ruse, [, 1986, ], 1998, ,, 253, ), .
